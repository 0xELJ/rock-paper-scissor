# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run `game.py` in your Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to choose between rock, paper, and scissors.
3. The computer's choice is generated randomly.
4. The result of the game is determined based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
   - Rock crushes scissors
   - Scissors cuts paper
   - Paper covers rock
5. If you want to play again, type 'yes' when prompted.

## Future Improvements

- Add a score tracking system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add more choices (like lizard and Spock) to make the game more interesting.
